Final Project Problem Statement
Course: SQL Fundamentals

This project demonstrates the proficiency in fundamental SQL concepts and skills related to database management and data manipulation. The project aims to solidify the understanding of working with databases using PostgreSQL or Redshift, focusing on essential tasks such as creating databases, designing tables, inserting and manipulating data, querying and filtering data, and performing data aggregation and analysis.

Project Objectives
Database Creation and Table Design

Create databases and tables to store relevant data.
Design tables with appropriate columns, data types, and constraints.
Data Insertion and Manipulation

Insert sample data into the created tables.
Update, delete, and manipulate data as necessary to simulate real-world scenarios.
Querying and Filtering Data

Write SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the tables.
Use filtering techniques to extract subsets of data based on criteria.
Aggregating and Analyzing Data

Perform aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) to analyze data.
Use GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to organize and sort data.
Data Manipulation and Transformation

Apply SQL statements to transform data into desired formats.
Use JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Project Tasks
Database Setup and Table Creation

Create a database environment suitable for SQL operations.
Design and implement tables with appropriate attributes and relationships.
Data Population

Insert sample data into the tables to facilitate query testing and analysis.
Querying and Data Retrieval

Develop SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the tables.
Implement filtering conditions and sorting mechanisms to extract relevant data subsets.
Data Aggregation and Analysis

Perform aggregation operations to derive meaningful insights from the data.
Use SQL functions to calculate metrics and statistics.
Advanced SQL Operations

Demonstrate proficiency in advanced SQL operations such as subqueries and nested queries.
Apply data manipulation techniques to achieve project-specific goals.
Deliverables
SQL Scripts: Include all SQL scripts used for database creation, table design, data insertion, and querying.
Documentation: Provide a project report outlining the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
Testing and Validation: Ensure all queries are tested and validated against expected results.
Code Repository: Host the project code and documentation in a public repository on GitHub or a similar platform
